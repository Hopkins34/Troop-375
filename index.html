                        <p class="Article__p">At Camp Burch, the Klondike event is a highlight of the year. Scouts compete in challenges inspired by the rugged survival skills of the Klondike Gold Rush. Activities include pulling sleds through obstacle courses, solving first-aid scenarios, and demonstrating leadership under pressure. The event fosters camaraderie, sharpens outdoor skills, and is a fun way to embrace the spirit of adventure in winter conditions.</p>
                        <p class="Article__p">The Klondike event not only tests scouts’ physical endurance and practical skills but also emphasizes the importance of problem-solving and adaptability in high-pressure situations. By working together to overcome challenges, scouts strengthen their bonds as a team and develop confidence in their abilities. Whether it’s navigating icy trails, starting a fire in the cold, or improvising solutions to unexpected problems, Klondike provides an unforgettable experience that embodies the core values of Scouting: preparedness, resilience, and teamwork.</p>
